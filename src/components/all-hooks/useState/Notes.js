/*
1 - The useState hook lets you add state to functional components.
2 - In classes, the state is always an object.
3 - With the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an Object.
4 - The useState hook returns an array with 2 elements.
5 - The first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter  function.
6 - New state value depends on the previous state value ? You can pass a function to the setter function.
7 - When dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.
