! What is useEffect..?
Ans - The effect hook let us perform side effects in the functional components. ( Allows us to implement the functionality of life cycles of classes.)

It is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount.

* Simply =  useEffect will run the function passed to it after every render. Therefore it has the same effect as the CDM, CDU, CWU.

 We simply pass the function that we desire to run after every render of the component.

 Thus its the alternative for these 3 lifecycle methods
